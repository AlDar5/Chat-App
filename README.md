# Chat-App-0.4

THIS BRENCH
GUI in progress


Just a simple Chat App with no encyption no GUI and clunky


How to use:
You are going to be prompted to either wait for a connection (become the server by pressing "w") or connect to someone (become the client and press "c")

If you decide to become the server you have to choose a port and forward it, and then give your IP to whoever you want to talk to as well as the port

And if you decide to become the client you just have to input the correct info when asked

Once connected you'll be able to type your message after ">"

It should be that simple

There is just the issue that when typing and receiving a message whatever you were typing will be split in you're screen but will be sent and received perfectly fine
